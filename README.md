# testrepo

This program is designed to mimic the wc command in a bash terminal on linux. To run this program, ensure that python 3 is 
installed on your machine. There are three types of commands that this program accepts, being <code>-l</code>, which counts the
number of lines, <code>-w</code>, which counts the words, and <code>-c</code>, which counts the characters. This program will also
function without these commands, displaying the count of lines, words, and characters. To properly run this command, enter into the
terminal <br> <code>pywc -c filename</code> or <code>cat filename | pywc -l</code>.
